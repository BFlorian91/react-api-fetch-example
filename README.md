## How it Works
This project fetches data from the [Covid-19 API](https://covid19-api.com/) ☠️[DEPRECATED]☠️ and displays it on a simple front-end page.

The data is fetched using the fetch API in React's useEffect hook. The fetched data is then stored in a state variable using React's useState hook. Finally, the data is displayed on the front-end using React's map method.

## Dependencies
React
React-DOM
